# Working with LaTeX in vim

It's been a while since I did LaTeX so it was good that [NUS Hackers][nht] did
their workshop, which has been uploaded to [YouTube][nlw].

Thanks to [TopBugNet][vlp] for the live preview [vim plugin][vpl]. Even if the
plugin [didn't work for me on Ubuntu 20.04][bug], it seems to run on 18.04/WSL
for some reason.

Probably something in the flags built-in vim was compiled with.

## Contents

Basic example which will be fleshed out more as we go along.

Includes a Makefile so I can use GNU Make on the command line.
