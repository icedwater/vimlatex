# Working with LaTeX in vim

It's been a while since I did LaTeX so it was good that [NUS Hackers][nht] did
their workshop, which has been uploaded to [YouTube][nlw].

Thanks to [TopBugNet][vlp] for the live preview [vim plugin][vpl]. Even if the
plugin doesn't quite work for me, it's a good idea.

## Contents

Basic example which will be fleshed out more as we go along.

Includes a Makefile so I can use GNU Make on the command line.
